    "## Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script processes and saves images from two directories, `./HazeFre_v0.001` and `./HaZed_v0.001`, into a third directory named `test`. The process is conducted in batches, iterating a specified number of times. Initially, the variable `k` is set to 20, and `l` is set to 10, representing the number of iterations. The outer loop runs `l` times, and within each iteration, an inner loop processes 20 images, ranging from `k-20` to `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each inner loop iteration, the script opens an image from the `HazeFre_v0.001` directory and a corresponding image from the `HaZed_v0.001` directory using the `j`-th index from the sorted lists of filenames, `clear` and `haze`. The images are optionally displayed using Matplotlib (though the display code is commented out). The script then saves the processed images into the `test` directory with new filenames indicating their index and whether they are clean images.\n",
    "\n",
    "After processing each batch of 20 images, the variable `k` is incremented by 20 to move to the next set of images in the following iteration of the outer loop. At the end of the script, a shell command lists and counts the number of files in the `test` directory, displaying the total number of processed images. This setup ensures organized processing and saving of image pairs for further use or analysis."

    "The provided code snippet is used to process and organize a subset of image files from two directories. Here's a detailed explanation of each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Selection of Images**:\n",
    "   The code begins by randomly selecting 20 image filenames from a list called `haze`. This list contains filenames of hazy images stored in a specific directory. The selection is random, ensuring that a diverse subset of images is chosen each time the code runs.\n",

    "   - **Opening the Hazy Image**: The hazy image is opened from its directory using its filename.\n",
    "   - **Constructing the Clean Image Filename**: The code then constructs the filename for the corresponding clean image. It extracts a numeric identifier from the hazy image’s filename and uses this identifier to create the filename for the clean image, which is stored in a different directory.\n",
    "   - **Opening the Clean Image**: The clean image is opened using the constructed filename.\n",
    "   - **Saving Processed Images**: Both the hazy and clean images are saved to a new directory named `test_its`. The filenames in this directory include an index number to distinguish them and a suffix to indicate whether they are clean or hazy images.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Counting the Number of Files**:\n",
    "   After processing and saving the images, the code counts and prints the total number of files in the `test_its` directory. This step verifies that the expected number of files (20) has been saved and helps confirm that the processing was completed successfully.\n",
